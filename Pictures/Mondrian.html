            The original image, “Tableau I” was created in 1921 by Mondrian is on the left.
Piet Mondrian is a well-known painter born in the Netherlands, originally Mondrian would make naturalistic landscape and still-life paintings. He joined the Theoscopic Society in 1909 after a major exhibition of his work was held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. That same year, Mondrian experienced pointillism (the technique in which small shapes are used in a pattern to resemble an image) and he further began to work in a “cubist” mode of painting.
After he viewed cubist works by  Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at the first Moderne Kunstkring exhibition in 1911, Mondrian moved to Paris from 1912 to 1914 where he developed his abstract painting style. Mondrian returned to the Netherlands and was caught in the middle of World War I, preventing any return to Paris. During this time, Mondrian reduced his geometric shapes and colors down to his now simplistic style.
