                My favorite things to do outside of school are playing video games and hanging out with friends.
                Typically me and my friends go to the beach or the mall to hangout. If were feeling like it we might 
                even go to the movies.

                my favorite class is geometry because I enjoy learning about the shapes that make-up our world.
                I prefer geometry over algebra as algebra is all numbers while geometry is more about shapes.

                A sport that I do is competitive swimming for PAQ. I have been swimming for roughly 8 years now and
                and only four years ago did I start taking it serious and consider it in my future.

                My least favorite class is chemistry because it makes my brain hurt. I am working towards liking
                chemistry more in the future.
